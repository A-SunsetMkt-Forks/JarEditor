## Quick start

### 1. Install plugin from marketplace

### 2. Edit and Build Jar
After installation , you can see a tab page to switch to Jar Editor in the .class decompiled file.

> **External jar** : File->Project Structure->Libraries->Add Library , then you can see the decompiled jar.<br>
> **Nested jar** : Right click on nested jar->JarEditor->Structure->Expand Nested Jar

After modification, click **Save(Compile)** to compile and save the currently modified java content. 

Finally click **Build Jar** to write the compiled and saved class file into the Jar package.

Modifying the resource files in the jar package is also supported.

Here is an example:

### 3. Class bytes tool
For obfuscated jars, the decompilation result is not satisfactory. In this case, you can use tools to directly modify the bytecode.
Click the **Class bytes tool** icon to select the tool

- **Javassist** : Field/method/constructor/static code can be modified/added/deleted (include inner class)

### 4. Other operations of JarEditor
In the project view of the jar package, right-click to see **JarEditor->New/Delete** and other operations, where you can add/delete/rename/copy/paste/export files.

Click the **Search** icon to search the contents of the jar package. If it is a class jar, it will be searched based on the decompiled content.

## Some mechanisms
- The JDK that the compilation depends on is the JDK of your SDK list. You can choose SDK and target version of the compiled class.
- The classpath you depend on when compiling java is the project's Libraries dependency. If the dependency package cannot be found, you can add Libraries(File->Project Structure->Libraries).
- Save(Compile) will save the modified files to the subdirectory **jar_edit_out** of the directory where the jar package is located. Build Jar will incrementally write the modified files to jar, and finally delete this directory.


### SDK Default Versions

When compiling and selecting **SDK Default**, the runtime JDK (JBR) integrated by Jetbrains is used. If SDK Default is not selected, the JDK installed by the specific user will be used.
